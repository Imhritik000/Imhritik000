# 👋 Hey there, I'm Hritik Choudhary — Welcome to my GitHub!

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a former professional badminton player from India 🇮🇳 who transitioned into the world of data analytics. After competing from 2018 to 2022 and working as a badminton game analyst until early 2025,
I decided to shift gears and dive deep into data.

## 💡 Why Data?

Just like sports, data demands discipline, strategy, and sharp insights. My background in competitive sports taught me focus, persistence, and performance under pressure 
— qualities I now apply to data analysis.

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack

- 📊 **SQL** – mastering queries, joins, subqueries, and more
- 🐍 **Python** – for data wrangling, analysis, and automation
- 🐼 **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
- 📈 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visual storytelling with data
- 📊 **Excel** – from basics to advanced dashboards

## 🚧 Ongoing Projects

- 🔍 **Data cleaning & analysis** case studies
- 📉 **Dashboard building** using Excel & Python
- 📂 End-to-end mini projects for resume & GitHub showcase

## 📌 Goals (2025)

- ✅ Build 4–5 strong portfolio projects
- 🔜 Earn relevant certifications (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- 🧑‍💻 Land my first role as a data analyst!
